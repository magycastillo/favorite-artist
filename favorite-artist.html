        <h2>“Everything alters me, but nothing changes me.”</h2>
        <p>
            Salvador Dalí spent much of his life promoting himself and shocking the world. He relished courting the
            masses, and he was probably better known, especially in the United States, than any other 20th-century
            painter, including even fellow Spaniard Pablo Picasso. He loved creating a sensation, not to mention
            controversy, and early in his career exhibited a drawing, titled SacredHeart, that featured the words
            “Sometimes I Spit with Pleasure on the Portrait of My Mother.” Publicity and money apparently mattered so
            much to Dalí that, twitching his waxed, upturned mustache, he endorsed a host of products for French and
            American television commercials. Diffidence was not in his vocabulary. “Compared to Velázquez, I am
            nothing,” he said in 1960, “but compared to contemporary painters, I am the most big genius of modern time.”

        <p>
            Dalí’s antics, however, often obscured the genius. And many art critics believe that he peaked artistically
            in his 20s and 30s, then gave himself over to exhibitionism and greed. (He died in 1989 at age 84.) Writing
            in the British newspaper The Guardian a year ago, critic Robert Hughes dismissed Dalí’s later works as
            “kitschy repetition of old motifs or vulgarly pompous piety on a Cinemascope scale.” When Dawn Ades of
            England’s University of Essex, a leading Dalí scholar, began specializing in his work 30 years ago, her
            colleagues were aghast. “They thought I was wasting my time,” she says. “He had a reputation that was hard
            to salvage. I have had to work very hard to make it clear how serious he really was.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Dalí’s Surrealist paintings are surely his finest work—even though his penchant for excess often led him to
                paint too many shocking images on a single canvas and too many canvases that seem to repeat themselves. But
                at his best, Dalí, a superb draftsman, could be spare and orderly. The Persistenceof Memory, for example,
                features three “melting” watches, and a fourth covered by a swarm of ants. One of the watches saddles a
                strange biomorphic form that looks like some kind of mollusk but is meant to be the deflated head of Dalí.
                When New York dealer Julien Levy bought the painting for $250 in 1931, he called it “10 x 14 inches of Dalí
                dynamite.” The work, which was acquired by New York City’s Museum of Modern Art in 1934, excited viewers
                even as it puzzled them. One critic urged readers to “page Dr. Freud” to uncover the meaning in the canvas.
